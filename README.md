_My third project in Android Developer Nanodegree course_
# Build It Bigger
In this project, I created an app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. The app consists of four modules:
1. A Java library that provides jokes
2. A Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes
3. An Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes
4. An Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display

# What have I learned from this project?
- Add free and paid flavors to an app, and set up your build to share code between them;
- Factor reusable functionality into a Java library;
- Factor reusable Android functionality into an Android library;
- Configure a multi-project build to compile your libraries and app;
- Use the Gradle App Engine plugin to deploy a backend;
- Configure an integration test suite that runs against the local App Engine development server.
